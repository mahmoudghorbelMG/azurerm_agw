List of the minimum tests that should be applied when developping new app gateway element:

- new resource creation
    * normal
    * with existing name
    * with/without required parameters
    * with/without optional parameters
    * with/without existing/incorrect referenced params (like probe name for backend http settings)
- resource deletion
- parameters modification
    * addition of some new ones
    * deletion
    * delete all
    * addition from zero conf
- name modification
    * normal (non existing name)
    * existing name
- manual parameters modification (the provider should detect new conf and set initial one)
    * addition
    * deletion
    * modification of existing one
- manual resource deletion

Problems:
- param AffinityCookieName in Backend_http_settings: When set to null initially, azure API don't allow changing it. 
    The solution is to put a default value ("ApplicationGatewayAffinity") as described in the Azure app gateway spec.
- the probe should be created before referencing it in backend http settings.
