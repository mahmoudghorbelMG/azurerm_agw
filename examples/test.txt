List of the minimum tests that should be applied when developping new app gateway element:

- new resource creation
    * normal
    * with existing name
    * with/without required parameters
    * with/without optional parameters
    * with/without existing/incorrect referenced params (like probe name for backend http settings)
- resource deletion
- parameters modification
    * addition of some new ones
    * deletion
    * delete all
    * addition from zero conf
- name modification
    * normal (non existing name)
    * existing name
- manual parameters modification (the provider should detect new conf and set initial one)
    * addition
    * deletion
    * modification of existing one
- manual resource deletion

Problems:
- param AffinityCookieName in Backend_http_settings: When set to null initially, azure API don't allow changing it. 
    Solution: put a default value ("ApplicationGatewayAffinity") as described in the Azure app gateway spec.
- the probe should be created before referencing it in backend http settings.
- can't make default value of string array (like status_code in probe.match).
    Solution: i make it required
- can't handle non optional SingleNestedAttributes like probe.match. 
    Solution: i make it required
- when we make a param as optional(1), computed(2), with default value(3) and put it with the default value(4),
if there is we delete this param in an update conf (plan), it is considered as "Nochanges" event
    Solution: no solution. Just keep it in mind and don't panic.
- when i use intDefaultModifier for minServers, if i update the conf by deleting it, the last value still exist while showing 
"no change" event in terraform plan. It should take the default value (0) and not keeping the last one
    Solution: i change "diags := tfsdk.ValueAs(ctx, req.AttributePlan, &str)" in intDefaultModifier by "diags := tfsdk.ValueAs(ctx, req.AttributeConfig, &str)"
